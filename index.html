<h1>Welcome to Shopper Inclination, by Ben Lubetkin!</h1>

<p>This project will take an initial look into a dataset concerning online shoppers and what makes them commit to a purchase. We will go about the basics of importing, cleaning, visualizing, and modelling the data to see if we can find certain factors that will impact people making online purchases. We will then discuss some operalization of our findings, that is, show what this knowledge could be used for.</p>

<p>For our initial data cleaning, visualization, and research questions:

<p>For our first model and discovering our first variables that will impact our model:

For our final model and operalization ideas:
