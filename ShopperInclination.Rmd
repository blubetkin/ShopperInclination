This data set is showing the inclination of online shoppers to buy certain products online when they are new or returning to a new website. It follows over 12,000 people as they buy and not buy. I chose this data set because I, as many others (at least 12,000), do enjoy partaking in online shopping, especially since credit cards are a thing and credit reports are just numbers. First, let us import the data and we can get started!

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
library("tidyverse")

Shoppers <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blubetkin/ShopperInclination/master/online_shoppers_intention.csv")
```
